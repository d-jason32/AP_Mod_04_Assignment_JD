## Description

This program allows you to input a csv file of weather data in the format Date,Temperature, Humidity and Precipitation. It can specify which dates had a temperature above 50 degrees, the average temperature for a month, the number of rainy days in a month, and categorize each date into hot, warm and cold. Data is presented to the user in a Java Text Block. 

This program uses modern Java features such as enhanced switch statements, lambdas, streams, records, text blocks, pattern matching for switch, and markdown support in Javadoc.
